### 📂 Digital Logic Design Portfolio

This repository features a comprehensive collection of **Digital Logic Design** projects implemented using **Verilog HDL** and **Xilinx Vivado**.   
The projects are structured progressively, ranging from fundamental Combinational Logic to advanced Sequential Logic, Finite State Machines (FSM), and Memory System Integration.

### 🛠 Tools & Environment
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **IDE:** Xilinx Vivado 2021.2
- **Simulation:** Vivado Simulator (XSim)
